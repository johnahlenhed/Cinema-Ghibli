        <span class="line"></span>
        <p>When you think you've lost your way, you may have just found your way. </p>
        <p>10-year-old Chihiro is on her way to a new home with her parents when they 
            accidentally take a detour - straight into a world unlike anything she has 
            known before. </p> 
        <p> When night falls, the place transforms into a bathhouse for spirits and supernatural 
            beings. Her parents have turned into pigs, and Chihiro is suddenly alone in a world 
            where the rules are incomprehensible and danger hides in the shadows. 
            But in the middle of this enchanted world, she meets Haku - an enigmatic 
            boy who becomes her ally. He warns her: if she forgets her name, she also forgets who 
            she is - and then she is trapped in the spirit world forever. </p>  
        <p> To survive and find her way back home, Chihiro must find the courage to stand up for 
            herself, and preserve the memory of who she once was.</p>
